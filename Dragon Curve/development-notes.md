#  Notes on development as we go along

Have the basic Sierpinski dragon curve, and Koch snowflake happening.  These are
straight-forward recursive functions, and the sequence data structure (a series of
angle changes, distances, with the possibility of mirroring orientations) handles things.
Will need to extend to more complete support of an L-System set of rewriting rules.

This should handle the Hilbert curve stuff, I think.

For the research paper -- might be better to go with a different batch of code
to generate the Hilbert ordering.
